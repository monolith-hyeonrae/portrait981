"""Observability system for FaceMoment.

This module re-exports the core observability components from visualpath
and adds FaceMoment-specific trace record types.

Provides tracing and logging infrastructure to track:
- Frame-by-frame extraction results
- Gate state transitions
- Trigger decision processes
- Component timing and performance
- Stream synchronization issues

Trace Levels:
- OFF: No tracing (production default)
- MINIMAL: Trigger events only (<1% overhead)
- NORMAL: Frame summaries + gate changes (~5% overhead)
- VERBOSE: Full signal details + timing (~15% overhead)

Example:
    >>> from facemoment.observability import ObservabilityHub, TraceLevel
    >>> hub = ObservabilityHub.get_instance()
    >>> hub.configure(level=TraceLevel.NORMAL)
    >>> hub.add_sink(FileSink("/tmp/trace.jsonl"))
    >>>
    >>> # In extractor code:
    >>> if hub.enabled:
    ...     hub.emit(FrameExtractRecord(...))
